# REACT MAPS 
### GPS TRACKER ###
- [ ] Real-time Tracking: The app provides real-time tracking of the target object or person on a map interface. Users can see the current location, as well as the route history.
- [ ] Map Interface: The app usually utilizes a map interface (such as Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) to display the tracked location. Users can zoom in/out, switch between map views (like satellite view or street view), and interact with the map for better visualization.
- [ ] Geofencing: Geofencing allows users to define virtual boundaries or geographical areas on the map. When the target object or person enters or exits these predefined areas, the app sends notifications or triggers specific actions.
